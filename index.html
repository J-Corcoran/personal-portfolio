      <h2>About me</h2>
      <article>
          <p>I'm a Web Developer, currently learning Advanced CSS and JavaScript. Soon to be learning Python, PHP and Java to work towards learning the full development stack. </p>

          <p>My previous experience has been in financial services, which I did enjoy and gained invaluble skills such as team working and attention to detail (there really isn't much room for error when dealing with money!). I've always loved computers and had a great interest in coding after seeing the power of just some simple Visual Basic when using Excel to improve quality and productivity. </p>
          
          <p>Having seen the power of coding I took the decision to learn coding and web development full time. My portfolio projects demonstrated here show that I have become a cabable developer and my passion for constant improvement and development will ensure I only improve to add value to any project I work on.</p>
